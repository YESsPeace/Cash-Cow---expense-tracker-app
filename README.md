# Money stat App

This is an application for tracking expenses and income and creating a budget. It is currently being developed as a school project.

## Features

The application is still in development, but it is planned to have four main menus:
- Accounts
- Categories of expenses and income
- Transaction history
- Budget creation

## Installation

The application is built using Python 3.10 and the Kivy and KivyMD frameworks. To install the application, simply download the appropriate file from the `download` folder or the link provided in the readme file.

## Usage

Data about transactions can be entered manually either in the transaction menu or the expense category menu. The application calculates each transaction in the history and generates a detailed report.
